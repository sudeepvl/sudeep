Python script developed for detecting P2P link metric mismatches between two ends of an ISIS adjacency, by parsing "show isis database level 1|2 detail" output.  
	Justification - ISIS metric not matched on both ends of links may result in Assymetric routing & also unforseen bandwith utilization issues.
Script also detects any routers which has got max-metric value on its interface, which might be a result of Config error or LDP SYNC issues.
	Justification - We have seen such max-metric values causing traffic not to take valid path resulting in outages in customer network and rechability issues.
